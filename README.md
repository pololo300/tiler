# Tiler

My first rust project hardly inspired in [svgtiler](https://github.com/edemaine/svgtiler). I created this project to automatize the creation of images for my final degree tesis, that is about tetris.

`tiler` takes for intput an txt file and ouputs a pdf. The input txt converts some charactes (see `.config.jsonc`) into square colored cells forming tetris pieces. If the '-f' (frame) argument is passed, a board is rednedred algonside with the pieces.
